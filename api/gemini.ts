// DEPRECATED: This server-side API approach is not compatible with the current static
// application architecture, causing the AI features to fail. All Gemini API logic has been
// moved to `services/geminiService.ts` to run directly on the client-side.
// This ensures functionality but exposes the API key in the client code. For a production
// environment, a proper backend or serverless function setup is recommended to secure the key.
